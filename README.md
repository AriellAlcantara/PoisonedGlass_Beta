# PoisonedGlass\_Beta

* # I almost lost this progress because my unity bugged and regressed all my work to day 1(took me almost 2 days to correct AI errors), luckily I made a mistake beforehand where I committed the update to the branch of Sir's branch and managed to get my file back successfully, I reverted the change already but yes.

# Progress(If nothing was truly lost):

* # Registration works, data is stored in the same asset folder in a folder named UserData stored as JSON
* # The username entered is sent to the server and displayed(During the recording I realized that this was lost)
* # The wins and loses are stored

# Problems:

* # The "Player List" Doesn't update(i need more time to figure it out)
* # The wins and loses can't be checked right now because the game is still incomplete
