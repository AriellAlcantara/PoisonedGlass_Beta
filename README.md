# PoisonedGlass\_Beta

* # Implemented week 8 requirements

# Progress:

* # Last date since login implemented
* # The delete button works and only activates if you type the correct password and username
* # The wins and loses are stored seperately but still shows up in json

# Problems:

* # The "Player List" Doesn't update(i need more time to figure it out)
* # The wins and loses can't be checked right now because the game is still incomplete
